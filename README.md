# WALLABY Public Data Releases

This repository provides information, tutorials and data access scripts for public releases of data from the Widefield ASKAP L-band Legacy All-sky Blind Survey (WALLABY). WALLABY is the all-sky 21-cm HI survey conducted with the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) in Western Australia. It will map a significant fraction of the southern sky with the aim to detect the HI emission from more than 200,000 galaxies in the nearby Universe out to a redshift of about 0.1.

**Note that this repository is still work in progress, and WALLABY has not released any data to the public yet. We will update this page with further instructions once the first data have actually been made available, which is currently expected to occur around mid November 2022.**
